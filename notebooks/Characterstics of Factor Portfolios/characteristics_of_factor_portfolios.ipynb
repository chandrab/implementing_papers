    "# Menchero, J., 2010. \"Characteristics of Factor Portfolios\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we look at risk and return has changed. There has been a monumental surge of interest in Risk premia or smart beta investing since the global financial crisis as investors stuggle with exposure to tail risk and hidden factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This new approach to investing has led to the rise of Factor models which are designed to cleanly disentangle the efects of multiple variables in concert. Factor models enable the active manager to distinguish between betting on the value factor as opposed to unintentionally betting on the financials sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example relies on the work of Menchero (completely plagerises is probably more accurate) to illustrate how such a Factor model can be implemented and interpreted. My main motivation for putting this together was due to the hours I have spent in the past searching Factor model code online to no avail. Hopefully some poor soul in a similar boat to myself will find this useful!\n",
